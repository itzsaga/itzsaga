## 🚀 From Serving Tables to Serving Code

I traded restaurant aprons for keyboards in 2017, completing an intensive 800+ hour bootcamp journey that transformed my career. Today, I'm a force multiplier in any domain I set my mind to. Sometimes the best career pivots happen when you least expect them! 

**Currently focused on:** Scaling platforms, mentoring emerging developers, and building tools that make developers' lives easier.

*"The best career advice I ever got: Your background isn't a liability, it's your superpower. Restaurant management taught me systems thinking, crisis management, and team leadership - skills that make me a better engineering leader every day."*

⭐️ **Fun challenge:** Can you find the TypeScript in my commit history? (Hint: It's everywhere now!)
